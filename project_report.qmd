# Preparing an Anonymous Submission

- Anonymous submissions must not include the author names and affiliations. Write "Anonymous Submission" as the "sole author" and leave the affiliations empty.
- The PDF document's metadata should be cleared with a metadata-cleaning tool before submitting it. This is to prevent leaked information from revealing your identity.
- References must be anonymized whenever the reader can infer that they are to the authors' previous work.
- AAAI's copyright notice should not be included as a footer in the first page.
- Only the PDF version is required at this stage. No source versions will be requested, nor any copyright transfer form.
- You may be required to include a reproducibility checklist or prepare it separately. Check the conference's instructions in their website.

You can remove the copyright notice and ensure that your names aren't shown by including
```yaml
draft: false
```
when rendering the document in Quarto.
