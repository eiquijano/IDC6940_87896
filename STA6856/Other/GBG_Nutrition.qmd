# About GBG Nutrition

At GBG Nutrition, we believe that health is not a destination, it’s a lifestyle. Our foundation is built on three guiding pillars: Growth, Balance, and Guidance. These principles shape everything we do, blending clinical expertise with a holistic approach to sustainable wellness.

-   

    ## Growth

    We see every client as a work in progress, not a problem to fix, but a journey to evolve. Whether your goal is improved energy, metabolic health, or mindful eating, we help you develop skills and habits that create sustainable progress.

-   

    ## Balance

    We don’t believe in extremes. Food is nourishment, joy, and connection. Our approach focuses on balance between health and enjoyment, body and mind, structure and flexibility so you can achieve wellness without losing the pleasure of eating.

    ## Guidance

    Personalized coaching, evidence-based education, and empathetic support are at the core of what we do. We guide you with clarity and accountability, helping you make confident decisions about your nutrition, movement, and lifestyle.

We don’t believe in rigid diets or quick fixes. Instead, we focus on helping you nourish your body and mind through evidence-based nutrition, mindful habits, and personalized care. Our goal is to empower you to live with energy, confidence, and balance for life.

## Isabel Quijano, MS, RD, LD/N

##### Registered Dietitian \| Maternal & Child Health Specialist \| Preventive Nutrition Advocate

I am a licensed and registered dietitian with a deep passion for helping people improve their health through the power of food. When you work with me, you’ll find a supportive, caring environment where we take a realistic, personalized approach to your nutrition and lifestyle goals.

For more than 16 years, I’ve had the honor of serving families through the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program, guiding clients across all life stages from preconception and pregnancy to family wellness and preventive care. My specialties include maternal and child health, general wellness, and lifestyle-based preventive nutrition.

I earned my Bachelor’s in Dietetics from the Central University of Venezuela and a Master of Science in Applied Nutrition from Northeastern University. I’ve been licensed in the state of Florida since 2009 and proudly maintain my credentials as a Registered Dietitian through the Commission on Dietetic Registration. My background also includes service in the U.S. Army as a Food Care Specialist, where I developed a deep appreciation for discipline, resilience, and the vital role of nutrition in all environments.

Outside of work, I love experimenting in the kitchen, exploring global flavors, and creating wholesome, delicious recipes. I’m committed to lifelong learning and continuously staying informed about the latest nutrition science to offer the most up-to-date, evidence-based guidance.
